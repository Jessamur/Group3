            <p>Keeping up with pool maintenance is important year-round to ensure a healthy
                swimming pool. One of the most important elements is the pool chemical levels. It's easy to overlook or
                ignore them, but even easier to maintain! This will save you time and money in the long run. The
                chemicals you put in your swimming pool help balance the water, making it safe to swim in. The right
                balance of these chemicals keeps your pool clean, and protects the pool finish from discoloration, as
                well. Most likely, you won't be changing out the pool water for several years and you'll have stagnate
                periods where it's not being used. A good filtration system and balance of chemicals will help your pool
                stay healthy, even when you aren't using it every day.

            Chlorine is added to the water to kill germs. When it is added to a swimming pool, it forms a weak acid
            called hypochlorous acid that kills bacteria like salmonella and E. coli, as well as germs that cause
            viruses such as diarrhea and swimmer's ear.

                The pH scale ranges from 0-14. A pH level of 0 indicates the highest level of acidity in the water. A pH
                level of 14 indicates a high level of alkalinity in the water. Therefore, it is best to try to keep the
                water at a pH level of 7, which indicates a good balance between acidity and alkalinity. Attempting to
                swim in a pool that has a pH level of less than 7 is akin to getting soap or shampoo in your eyes.
                Exposed skin could become irritated, red and itchy. If highly acidic water makes contact with the eyes
                or is swallowed, it could cause a serious medical emergency that needs to be addressed right away. If
                you have a metal ladder that leads to the pool, the ladder could erode or become unstable. That could
                create another dangerous situation and a potential lawsuit if someone were to get hurt in your pool.When
                the pH level is higher than 7, it could create a situation where the water is cloudy, bacteria or other
                pathogens in the water are not properly dealt with and issues could occur with the plumbing equipment
                used in the pool. If the water is too cloudy or dirty, it could create a health hazard for everyone who
                uses the pool.
